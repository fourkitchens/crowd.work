# Crowd Work
Team discussion organization tool, built on Meteor.

# Getting Started

## Installing meteor (unix-based machines):

* Run: `curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`

## Running crowd.work
* Change your current directory to the src subdirectory, like: `cd /path/to/crowd.work/src`.
* Run meteor inside of meteor's root: `meteor`
* Meteor will initialize itself, install it's dependencies, and tell you when it's finished.
* When Meteor has finished initializing itself, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Of course, you can put it on any port you would like, but by default Meteor takes over port 3000.
