## Running crowd.works
* Change your current directory to the root of the meteor application, like this: `cd /path/to/crowd.work/src`.
* Run meteor inside of meteor's root.
* Meteor will initialize itself, install it's dependencies, and tell you when it's finished.
* When Meteor has finished initializing itself, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Of course, you can put it on any port you would like, but by default Meteor takes over port 3000.
